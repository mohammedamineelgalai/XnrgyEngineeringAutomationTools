Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Services.Connection Namespace > IFileManager Interface : AcquireFiles Method 

The settings which specify the files to operate on and other options which determine how to handle the files with regards to fixing broken references, overriding existing files on disk, etc. The settings also contain delegates where custom handlers for progress and restrictions can be plugged in. 
Downloads and/or checks out files form the vault
Syntax
Visual Basic C# AcquireFilesResults AcquireFiles( 
   AcquireFilesSettings settings
)'Declaration
 
Function AcquireFiles( _
   ByVal settings As AcquireFilesSettings _
) As AcquireFilesResults 
Parameters
settings 
The settings which specify the files to operate on and other options which determine how to handle the files with regards to fixing broken references, overriding existing files on disk, etc. The settings also contain delegates where custom handlers for progress and restrictions can be plugged in.
Return Value
An object which details the objects that were downloaded, any references that were fixed, and any errors that might have occurred
Remarks
This method still benefits from parallel downloads like AcquireFilesAsync method, but doesn't return control to the caller until the download is complete. This is achieved by waiting on the async download operation. To avoid deadlock issues, however, this method uses a unique wait behavior that will result in the calling thread to process incoming messages from other threads. If this method is called from the GUI thread, this means the GUI will not block while this method executes.
Requirements
Target Platforms: Windows 7, Windows Vista SP1 or later, Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2008 (Server Core not supported), Windows Server 2008 R2 (Server Core supported with SP1 or later), Windows Server 2003 SP2

Classes
  Class Description 
Class CaseSensitivityConstraint  This policy is used to created a case sensitivity policy for a Text property. For example, a text property value may be in All Capps 
Class ContentSourcePropertyDefinition  Describes a property definition that lives in a content file (ie. An office document, an inventor document, an autocad document) 
Class ContentSourcePropertyMapping  This class represents an individual mapping between a PropertyDefinition and a ContentSourcePropertyDefinition 
Class ContentSourceProvider  A content source provider is an object that provides the ability to extract properties from a source and make those properties available for mapping to object properties in the vault. An example of a content source provider would be Inventor. The Inventor content source provider knows how to extract properties from Inventor files. 
Class EnforceListOfValuesConstraint  This policy is used to created an enforcement policy for properties that contain a List Of Values. The policy allows you to specify whether property values must be part of the list of values. For example, if a property has a List of Values of A, B, and C, and the property has a value of D, then this determines whether or not that should be considered a policy violation. 
Class EntityStatus  Represents the status of a local file relative to its related vault file. 
Class EntityStatusImageInfo  This is a specialized ImageInfo that bundles an EntityStatus with the rest of the image details. 
Class ImageInfo  This object is returned by Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Services.Connection.IPropertyManager.GetPropertyValues for properties of DataType=PropertyDefinition.PropertyDataType.ImageInfo. This object contains an image and information about that image. 
Class MaximumDateConstraint  This policy is used to created a maxmimum value for a Date property. For example, a date property value may not be greater than 01/01/2020 
Class MaximumLengthConstraint  This policy is used to created a maxmimum length for a text property. For example, a text property value may not be greater than 10 characters long. 
Class MaximumValueConstraint  This policy is used to created a maxmimum value for a number property. For example, a numeric property value may not be greater than 1000 
Class MinimumDateConstraint  This policy is used to created a minimum value for a Date property. For example, a date property value must be at least 01/01/2010 
Class MinimumLengthConstraint  This policy is used to created a minimum length for a text property. For example, a text property value must be at least 5 characters long. 
Class MinimumValueConstraint  This policy is used to created a minimum value for a number property. For example, a numeric property must have a value of at least 10 
Class PropertyConstraint  This abstract base class represents a policy on the value of a property. For example, "the property value must be at least 6 characters long". It can be used to test the value of a property to see if it violates the constraint. 
Class PropertyDefinition  Represents the definition of Property. A PropertyValue represents a physical property value. For example, a file has an Author property value of "Michael". In this example, "Michael" is the property value and Author is the PropertyDefinition. 
Class PropertyDefinition.DefinitionConstraints  This class manages the collection of constraints associated with a PropertyDefinitionproperty Definition. 
Class PropertyDefinition.EnumeratedValue  Represent a possible value that can occur in a PropertyDefinition.ValueList (or List Of Values). A List Of Values are the recommended (and sometimes enforced) values that the user should select from when entering a property value. 
Class PropertyDefinitionDictionary  This class is a collection (dictionary) of PropertyDefinition objects with a dual key. Each item in the collection has a "long" ID key and a "string" key. The long key is typically a database id, and can not be used to persist from session to session because migrations can cause the value to change. The "string" key is a system name that is unique across all PropertyDefinitions and can be persisted from session to session. 
Class PropertyDefinitionIds  This class contains constants for well-known System Names of PropertyDefinitions 
Class PropertyDefinitionIds.Client  System names for Client PropertyDefinitions. Client PropertyDefinitions are ones that are computed on the client, but the server doesn't know about them. These PropertyDefinitions can be shown in any UI, but they can not be searched or otherwise administered. 
Class PropertyDefinitionIds.Server  System names for well know server Property definitions. The comments for each property will indicate the PropertyDefinition.SystemName of the PropertyDefinition 
Class PropertyMappings  This class stores all of the mappings for a single PropertyDefinition 
Class PropertyValue  Represents a property value for a particular entity 
Class PropertyValues  This class represents several Property Values bundles together in a single object. 
Class PropertyValueSettings  Optional settings that can be passed to the Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Services.Connection.IPropertyManager.GetPropertyValues api 
Class RequiresValueConstraint  This policy is used to created a policy that determines whether or not a property value is required. For example, if a required policy is sent, then a property without a value will be considered a policy violation. 
Class ThumbnailInfo  This object is returned by Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Services.Connection.IPropertyManager.GetPropertyValues for properties of DataType=PropertyDefinition.PropertyDataType.Image, which is typically used for Thumbnails. This object contains the image and information about that image.

Best Practices  
Send Feedback  
Glossary Item Box
Here are a few guidelines to help you develop stable and performant Vault applications.

Communicating with the Vault Server

Make sure to handle errors properly when making a server call.  At the bare, minimum you should handle generic Exceptions.  However it's a better user experience if you provide more detailed information about why the error occurred.
Errors from a Vault server call generally fall into one of 3 categories: 
Error from the server.  These errors show up as SoapExceptions.

Error from a Web Service Command Extension.  These errors show up as ExtensionExceptions with restriction information.

Error from somewhere else, such as a network failure.  These can be handled as regular Exceptions. 
Remember that Vault is a multi-user environement.  Another user might delete the file your program is currently working on.  The general rule is to expect the best but prepare for the worst. 
Each server call is an expensive operation, so try to minimize the number of calls. 
Don't make fequent calls.  For example, it would be bad if a Window's OnPaint event resulted in an Vault server call. 
Try to get all the information in a single call if possible.  For example if you want to get 10 Folder objects, its better to call GetFoldersByIds once than to call GetFolderById 10 times.
However, there is a 50 MB limit on data that can be transfered in a single call.  So if you have thousands of things to get, it might not be possible to do in a single call. 
Cache data whenever possible.  For example, if you call GetFolderRoot once in your application, you probably don't need to call it again. 
The lifetime of object ID values are not guaranteed.  So if you want to store data long-term, it's better to use something like a name instead of the ID. 
If you SignIn to Vault, make sure to SignOut when you are done.  The SignOut is what frees up a license in Vault Workgroup and Professional. 
If you did not SignIn (in other words, a login context was passed in to your code) do not SignOut.  Whoever passed you the login context may still be making server calls. 


Extending Job Processor

Don't have any UI in your job handler.  Job Processor is designed to be run as a service.  If you pop up a Dialog, there may not be a user around to click on it.  Effectively, the entire process would be locked up. 
Don't assume jobs will be processed in any order.  Because mutliple Job Processors may be running on the network, you can't assume that the first job on the queue will get completed first. 
Remember that Jobs are not executed instantly.  If the queue is backed up, it may be hours before a job reaches a job handler. 
Don't assume that the Vault is in the same state as when the job was queued.  For example, the job may be referencing a file that no longer exists. 

Extending Web Service Commands

Don't have any UI in your event handler.  You don't know which applications your handler may be loaded in.  It may be the case that you are loaded into a service, or console application.

If you want to block the operation, make sure to provide an adequate description of the problem when the Restriction is added. 
Make sure to handle errors in your event handlers.  Don't let the Exception bubble up if it can be avoided. 
Within your event handler, try not to perform an operation that could itself fire an event.  For example, checking out a file in your lifecycle state change event handler.
If you can't avoid the operation, make sure to add code to prevent infinite recursion.

Parameters
propDefId 
The unique id of the PropertyDefinition that is being mapped
entityClassId 
The ID of the Entity Class that this mapping applies to (ie. Applies to FILE entities)
contentPropertyDef 
The ContentSourcePropertyDefinition that is being mapped
readPriority 
When there are multiple ContentSourcePropertyDefinitions with read mappings to a single PropertyDefinition, this is the order that the mappings should be evaluated. Lower priority mappings are evaluated first.
writePriority 
When there are multiple PropertyDefinitions with write mappings to a single ContentSourcePropertyDefinition, this is the order that the mappings should be evaluated. Lower priority mappings are evaluated first.
isDefaultValueMap 
If True, then this mapping only applies to how default values are assigned. If False, then this mapping applies to standard property editing, check-in and check-out scenarios
mappingDirection 
Determines the mapping direction between the PropertyDefinition and the ContentSourcePropertyDefinition
createNew 
For mappings which allow writing to content source files, this determines if a property can be created if it doesn't exist. If False, then properties can be modified but not created.

Editing Items

Knowledge Base > Editing Items 
Glossary Item Box
Introduction
Editing Items in the Item Service is similar to editing Files in the Document Service.  The words are different but the same three steps are involved.  Step 1:  Reserve the object for editing.  Step 2: Perform the edit.  Step 3: Finalize the changes and relinquish control of the object.

Here is a table of how those three steps work for Files and Items:

  Files (Document Service) Items (Item Service) 
Reserve the object Check-out the File Create an editable Item object 
Perform the Edit Edit the File on disk Modify the Item object 
Finalize the changes and relinquish control Check-in the File Commit the Item 

 

Creating Editable Items
Edits can only occur on editable version of Items.  An editable Item is similar to a checked-out File.  The Item is now locked to a specific user.  Nobody else can make changes.  Unfortunately there is no property on an Item object which tells if it is editable or not.  Editable Items are created by calling certain API functions.  So it's up to the client programmer to keep track of which Items are editable and which are not.

Items Locks
When an editable Item is created, an invisible lock is created on that Item.  The lock is set to a specific user and login time.  So if a client begins and edit and logs out before the edit is complete, then they will not be able complete the edit since the login time will be different.  The result is an Item which nobody can edit.  Locks expire after 20 minutes as a safeguard.  This feature also means that all Item edits must be done within a 20 minute window.  If the user begins an edit, goes to lunch, then attempts to complete the edit, the server will throw an error. 

There are 3 ways to get rid of an Item lock:
- Commit the edit.
- Undo the edit.
- Wait 20 minutes for the lock to expire.

Committing Item Changes
A commit of an Item is the same as a check-in of a File.  It finalizes the changes and removes the lock on the Item.  There are several 'commit' functions.  UpdateAndCommitItems is used in most cases, but there are cases where the 'commit' function is paired with a specific 'edit' function.  For example, RollbackItemLifeCycleStates begins the edit and CommitRollbackItemLifeCycleStates commits the edit.  There are other cases where the edit and commit is completed in a single call (ex. UpdateItemRevisionNumbers).  Make sure to read the product documentation closely.

Undoing Item Changes
It's important to roll-back the change if anything goes wrong.  If things are not cleaned up properly than the Items may be stuck in a locked state, where everybody has to wait 20 minutes before using the Item.  A lot of burden is placed on the client to keep-track-of and clean-up locked Items.

Here is the recommended code structure:

try {  // get the editable item        // edit the item        // commit the edit}catch{       // undo the edit}

 

Just like with 'commit' functions, there are several 'undo' functions.  Usually UndoEditItems is used, but in some cases the undo is paired with a specific 'edit' function.  For example, UndoRollbackItemLifeCycleStates undoes the edit started by RollbackItemLifeCycleStates.

Errors and Restrictions

Knowledge Base > Errors and Restrictions

You are probably reading the error code incorrectly.  I'm guessing that you are getting it from the Message text of an Exception that gets thrown when you make an API call.  Although the Message usually contains the code, it's not the "correct" place to get it. 

The correct thing to do is catch the SoapException, then check the Details property, which is a bunch of XML data.  The Vault error code can be found between the <sl:errorcode> tags. Also, some errors will be accompanied by extra information in the form of a string array, found between the <sl:param> tags. Each parameter will have its own tag and "pid", which is an index value starting at 1. Most errors will not have extra parameters.  See the Error Codes page for more information.

If you don't get a SoapException, it means that the error is not coming from the Vault server.  Something else is causing the error, such as a network error.

Restrictions
Restrictions can be thought of as extended error information.  In the case of an Exception from the Vault server, there is one and only one error code.  Restrictions, however, can have multiple codes.  This is useful for complex operations where multiple things can fail at once, and you want to display everything to the user in a single dialog.

If the error code is 1092, 1387, or 1633, then you need to examine the restriction information to find out what the problem is.  For all other errors, there is no restriction information.

Just like with errors, you need to examine the Details XML in the Soap Exception.  The Restriction Codes page has more information.

Sample Code
Here is some code to help you out.  If the Exception is coming from the vault server, the following function will return both the Vault server error code and any restriction codes.

C#:

public static void GetErrorAndRestrictionCodesString(Exception e,
    out string errorCode, out List<string> restrictionCodes)
{
    SoapException se = e as SoapException;
    errorCode = null;
    restrictionCodes = new List<string>();
    string [] restrictionErrors = new string [] 
    { "1092", "1387", "1633" };      

    if (se != null)
    {
        try
        {
            errorCode = se.Detail["sl:sldetail"]["sl:errorcode"].InnerText.Trim();

            if (restrictionErrors.Contains(errorCode))
            {
                XmlNodeList nodes = se.Detail["sl:sldetail"]["sl:restrictions"].ChildNodes;

                foreach (XmlNode node in nodes)
                {
                    if (node.Name == "sl:restriction")
                    {
                        XmlElement element = node as XmlElement;
                        if (element != null)
                            restrictionCodes.Add(element.GetAttribute("sl:code"));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        catch
        { }
    }
}
 


VB:

Public Shared Sub GetErrorAndRestrictionCodesString(ByVal e As Exception, _
ByRef errorCode As String, ByRef restrictionCodes As List(Of String))
    Dim se As SoapException = TryCast(e, SoapException)
    errorCode = Nothing
    restrictionCodes = New List(Of String)()
    Dim restrictionErrors As String() = New String() {"1092", "1387", "1633"}

    If se IsNot Nothing Then
        Try
            errorCode = se.Detail("sl:sldetail")("sl:errorcode").InnerText.Trim()

            If restrictionErrors.Contains(errorCode) Then
                Dim nodes As XmlNodeList = se.Detail("sl:sldetail")("sl:restrictions").ChildNodes

                For Each node As XmlNode In nodes
                    If node.Name = "sl:restriction" Then
                        Dim element As XmlElement = TryCast(node, XmlElement)
                        If element IsNot Nothing Then
                            restrictionCodes.Add(element.GetAttribute("sl:code"))
                        End If
                    End If

Event Scope  
Send Feedback  
Knowledge Base > Event Scope 
Glossary Item Box
by Doug Redmond, It's All Just Ones and Zeros
07/22/2011



Although the web service events feature was designed to hook to all Vault clients on a computer, it doesn't meant that it is required to hook to them all.  Sometimes you want to hook to an event for just one application, and that's fine too.

I'll refer to the scope of the event as the set of applications that you are interested in receiving events from.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 1:  Global scope

If you want to get events from all Vault clients on a computer, you can follow the instructions in the SDK documentation.  The Web Service Command Events page in the Getting Started section goes over all the details.  Here is a basic summary:

Create a DLL project. 
Create a class that implements the IWebServiceExtension interface. 
Subscribe to events in the OnLoad() function. 
Write your event handler logic. 
Set your <extensionType> to WebService in the .vcet.config file. 
Deploy to the ProgramData folder. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 2:  Vault Explorer scope

Let's say you only care about events within your Vault Explorer plug-in.  For example, you have a custom command or tab view that needs to know about these events.  The steps are different in this case:

Open up the DLL project for your Vault Extension. 
Do not implement the IWebServiceExtension interface. 
Subscribe to events in the OnStartup() function for your IExplorerExtension implmentation. 
Write your event handler logic. 
Your <extensionType> is still VaultClient in the .vcet.config file.  No changes or additions are needed. 
Deployment is still to the ProgramData folder.  Again, no changes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 3:  CAD application scope using a plug-in

If you are plugging into a CAD app, the steps are very similar to scenario 2.  The main difference is that your plug-in will have a different set of rules on how to set up and deploy.  Here are the steps, at a high level:

Open up the project for your CAD plug-in. 
Do not implement the IWebServiceExtension interface. 
During startup, subscribe to the web service events from the Vault API.  This assumes that the CAD API framework lets your code run during startup. 
Write your event handler logic. 
Deploy according to the rules of the CAD framework. 
This technique will allow you to hook to all the Vault web service events for that CAD application, even if another plug-in fired them.  For example, you can write your own AutoCAD plug-in which responds to events from the default Vault plug-in.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario 4:  "Application X" scope without using a plug-in

If you want to scope your event to an application, but you can't write a plug-in, there is still an option.  All you need to do is follow scenario 1.  In step 4, when you are writing your event handler logic, check the name of the running process.  If it's not an application you want events from, exit the function.

There is no perfect way I know of to get the name of the current process.  The safest ways is probably to can use the first value from System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() to find the application name.  You can also use System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName, but it might throw security exceptions depending on the user permissions.  System.Windows.Forms.Application.ExecutablePath is also unreliable because it only works for Windowed applications.

The nice thing about this technique is that you can allow multiple applications.  Or you could use it to exclude specific applications.  For example, you exit the event handler if the application name is "JobProcessor.exe".

Extension Loading Error Logging  
See Also Send Feedback  
Knowledge Base > Extension Loading Error Logging 
Glossary Item Box
By Dan Dulzo


Sometimes, Vault extensions are loaded into environments without a GUI, such as an event handler. Unfortunately, if the extension fails to load due to errors such as the ones found here, it will fail silently. As an SDK programmer, this can cause confusion when trying to develop and deploy an extension. Fortunately, the SDK can be configured to log these errors, allowing developers to see (and hopefully fix) what went wrong when loading an extension.

Configuring Logging

To enable logging, deploy an xml file named ExtensionLogConfig.xml to the same directory that extensions are deployed to (C:\Program Data\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions). Upon loading an extension, this directory is checked for the configuration file, and if it is found, logging is enabled. The ExtensionLogConfig.xml file has a pretty simple format. An example can be seen below.

 

ExtensionLogConfig.xml Copy Code 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ExtensionLoggerConfiguration>
  <BaseFileName>C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\ExtensionLog_</BaseFileName>
  <DateFormat>_yyyyMMdd</DateFormat>
  <KeepLogsFor>1</KeepLogsFor>
  <FileExtension>.txt</FileExtension>
</ExtensionLoggerConfiguration>

 

 

The BaseFileName element specifies the location of the output log file, as well as the base file name of the file. The DateFormat element tells the logger the how to format the date when appending it to the log file name. The KeepLogsFor sets the number of days to keep log files for. The logger will attempt to automatically delete log files with a date older than the specified number of days. Using a value of -1 will cause the logger to delete any previous log information each time an extension attempts to load. Finally, the FileExtension element is used to specify the file extension to use for the log files.

 

 Note: If there are no extensions to load, logging will not be performed regardless of any configuration file.  Also, if the configuration file cannot be read due to being malformed or any other reason, logging will not be enabled.
 

 

The logger will write out what extensions load successfully and various error messages for extensions that failed to load. Most errors will result in a descriptive message getting written to the error log. Problems such as having incorrect assembly attributes or missing a public contructor for your extension class should be easy to identify when reading the log. 

 

Common Problems

 

Unfortunately, the logger will not be able to provide a useful message in certain situations when the extension loader doesn't know enough about why an extension failed to load. In these cases, the log will contain a generic message resembling "Could not load file or assembly..." or sometimes no message at all. Below are some descriptions of common problems and likely solutions to a few situations where the logger will be unable to provide specific information about why an extension failed to load.

 

Problem 1: No log file is created

 

If an extension is failing to load and there is no log file being created, double-check that your ExtensionLogConfig.xml file is properly formatted xml. Ensure that the configuration file has appropriate values for all of the configuration settings, i.e. the complete file name is valid, DateFormat is an appropriate date format string, Vault has permision to create files in the directory specified in BaseFileName, etc. Next, check that the ExtensionLogConfig.xml has been deployed to the correct directory. A common mistake here is deploying an ExtensionLogConfig.xml file to each extension's directory. There should be only one configuration file and it should be deployed to the Extensions directory(C:\Program Data\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\ExtensionLogConfig.xml), NOT to a specific extension's directory (C:\Program Data\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\[Some Extension's Name]\ExtensionLogConfig.xml). Finaly, check to make sure at least one extension is configured to load because no log file is created if there will be nothing to log.

 

Problem 2: An extension failed to load but there is nothing about the failed extension in the log file

 

There log file will always output messages for extensions that successfully load and extensions that try to load. If there are no message of an extension in the log file, it essentially means that Vault is unaware of the extension, and in fact, didn't even try to load it. The key thing to check in this situation is the .vcet.config file that is supposed to be deployed along with each extension. Make sure this file has the right name, is well formed, contains all the necessary information about the extension, and is in the correct directory. It's important to remember that the .vcet.config file is what lets Vault know of each extension to load. Another issue to check is that all extension files are deployed to the correct directory as well.

 

Problem 3: The log contains the vague error message of "Could not load file or assembly..."

 

For whatever reason, the extension loader could not load some sort of file or assembly referenced by an extesion. The most common root cause of this message is that something is missing. Usually, the first thing to check is that all assemblies referenced by an extension are deployed along-side it (unless they are available in the GAC). Please note that certain SDK assemblies referenced by an extension do not need to be deployed with each extension because they are already loaded by Vault. Another possible cause is that the failed extension references the wrong version of the SDK assemblies, so be sure to check this as well.

Introduction:
For base Vault we have 2 concepts that are simple on their own but start to get complex when you mix them together. 
The first concept is File Versions.  Every time you edit a file, you get a new version. Simple.
The second concept is File Associations.   Files can be linked to each other in a parent/child relationship.  This allows you to create dependency trees.  Again, simple.

Now lets mix the concepts together.  A file association is between one version of a file and another.  This means that the depencency tree might change for each version of a file.


Here is where the confusion starts.  You have a big chunk of data and multiple ways of traversing the data.  The good news is that the API has some built in tools to help you.

Example:
Let's go through a simple example.  First we upload 2 new files, A and B.  A is the parent of B.  This is what things look like in Vault.


Next we will check out B and check it back in with a new file, C.  B is the parent of C.  Our view now looks like this.


If we start at A and want to get the entire depenency tree, base Vault gives you 2 two types of traversals:

Snapshot in time:  You want to view the tree exactly as it looked when it was uploaded.  GetFileAssociationsByIds in the Document Service is that function that will give you this view.  If you started with file A and wanted all children, you would get this view:



Get latest:  You want to get the most recent version of all the files involved.  GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds in the Document Service is the function that will give you this view.  If you started with file A and wanted all children, you would get this view:



That's all you need to know for base Vault.  Now I will go over concepts added by Vault Workgroup. 

Vault Workgroup concepts:
Again we have 2 concepts that are simple on their own, but become complex when added to everything else.
First we have Revisions, which is a way to give meaning to a set of versions.  For purposes of this article, I'll be using alpha characters for revisions and numeric characters for versions.



The next concept is release States, which is a way of saying that a file is completed if it is in a certian lifecycle state.  At the API level, there is a boolean property on LfCycState which tells if the state is a release state or not.  A lifecycle definition usually has only one release state, but it is possible to have 0 or multiple release states. For the purposes of this article, releasesstates will have a darker color than the other states.



One final note:  The Vault clients are set up to update files associations only with the physical file changes.  If it's just a change to the Vault data (for example, changing lifecycle state) then the new file version points to the same files that the old version did.

Example:
Let's go over an example.  Here we have 2 files, a parent and a child.  Both files have gone through revsion and lifecycle changes.  The arrows represent direct associations between the file versions.



The Vault API provides 5 ways to traverse this data.  In all these cases, we are starting at the Parent and asking for the entire dependency tree.

Get Latest - no release bias

This is useful for CAD engineers who want the latest version of all the files so that they can work on them.
At the API level, you call GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds in the Document Service and pass in 'false' for the releasedBiased parameter.


Get Latest - release bias

This is useful for people outside the CAD department who are not interested in the 'work in progress' data.  They just want to see the latest completed product.
At the API level, you call GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds in the Document Service and pass in 'true' for the releasedBiased parameter.


Snapshot in Time by Version

This is useful in cases where you don't care about revisions.  The result is what you would get in base Vault, you only get the direct relationships between file versions.
At the API level, you call GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds in the Document Service.


Snapshot in Time by Revision - no release bias

This gives you the latest version within a revision, regardless of the lifecycle state.
At the API level, you call GetRevisionFileAssociationsByIds in the Document Service and pass in 'false' for the releasedBiased parameter.


Snapshot in Time by Revision - release bias

This gives you the latest release version within a revision.  If no released version exists, the latest one in the revision is returned.
At tAt the API level, you call GetRevisionFileAssociationsByIds in the Document Service and pass in 'true' for the releasedBiased parameter.


Putting it All Together:
You should be properly confused by now.  However there is a rule that will simplify things. 
Rule:  When dealing with revisions, think in terms of revisions.  Don't think in terms of versions.
 

Behind the scenes, revisions only care about 2 versions:  the latest version in the revision and the latest released version in the revision.  Many times these 2 are the same thing.  When thinking in terms of revisions you need to forget about all other versions. 

So let's redo the dependency tree for 4 and 5.  This time viewing things in terms of revisions.

Snapshot in Time by Revision - no release bias



Snapshot in Time by Revision - release bias


There, much better.

File Resolution  
Send Feedback  
Knowledge Base > File Resolution 
Glossary Item Box
by Doug Redmond, It's All Just Ones and Zeros
05/12/2011

At its simplest, the File Resolution feature is about fixing up broken file references if a file is moved or renamed. To enable this feature, file associations contain meta-data.  This meta-data is used to A) detect when a reference is broken and B) provide information necessary to fix the reference.

This file association meta-data can be seen when examining AddFile and CheckinFile methods of the DocumentService.  The parameter of interest is the FileAssocParam[] named associations. 

The association parameter is an array of FileAssocParam objects.  The FileAssocParam class contains the child file ID, the source meta data, the association type (attachment or dependency), the RefId, and the ExpectedVaultPath properties.

The child file ID (CldFileId) is pretty self-explanatory. This is the Id of the file that is going to be associated as a child of whatever file you are adding or checking in.

Source specifies which application is responsible or 'owns' the associate. This is used to help identify which resolver needs to be run when correcting broken associations. When adding or checking in a file, it is recommended to set this value the previous value or null if there is no previous value.

The Typ property specifies what kind of association the child file has to the parent file as described by the AssociationType enum. If the parent file does not require the child file to open properly, the type of the association should be an attachment. Common examples of this type of association is anything that is strictly additional information for the related to the parent. If the parent file requires the child file, such as an assembly using an inventor part file, then the Typ should be set to AssociationType.Dependency.

RefId is meta-data indicating how to locate the reference within the parent file.  This data is file-type specific and is not something you want to set yourself.  The CAD plug-in will set this up when files are added in.  If you are doing an update, you need to re-specify the associations at check in, so just pass in the RefIds from the associations on the previous version.

ExpectedVaultPath is the vault location of the child file.  This piece is used to detect when moves or renames happen.  The word expected is there because you can never be 100% sure of that location.  Because Vault is a multi-user environment, it's possible that someone else renamed that child right before you do your check-in.  The system is architected so that you don't need to know the exact path at the moment of check-in.  You just need to know the path that the parent is expecting the child to be in.  The File Resolve framework will do the rest.

If you are reading file associations on an existing file, there some new parameters on FileAssoc.  The ExpectedVaultPath shows up here.  There is also a new property called VaultPathChanged.  This property is a boolean that indicates that broken reference has been found.  If the current Vault path is not equal to the expected Vault path for either the parent or the child, the value will be TRUE. 

When broken references are detected, components called Resolvers are in charge of fixing up the references.  Resolvers run client-side and are file-type specific.  Currently we only have resolvers for AutoCAD, Inventor and Navisworks files.  All other files cannot participate in the file resolution feature.

A Resolver is not something you should be dealing with directly. The utility Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.ExtensibilityTools.IExplorerUtil contains DownloadFile() functions that will do the download and run the Resolver.  However, the older function Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.DocumentService.DownloadFile() will not run the resolver.  The reason is that the WebServices DLL is about server communication, not client-side operations. 

If you used checksum in the past to locate files, that's no longer a good mechanism.  Because the files are modified client-side, the checksum will no longer match the Vault checksum.  So you need to use things like filename, path, and last modified date to match between local and Vault files.

The File Resolution feature is a difficult one to consume from an API standpoint, but the end user experience is a very positive one.  In earlier versions of vault it was very difficult for a user to move and rename files, especially if a file was used in many places.  Under the new model, files can be easily and quickly moved and renamed.

File Versions and Links in the Selection Set  
Send Feedback  
Knowledge Base > File Versions and Links in the Selection Set 
Glossary Item Box
by Doug Redmond, It's All Just Ones and Zeros
6/28/2011

If you are working with custom Vault Explorer commands or tabs, then you probably deal with selection sets.  Vault 2012 adds some cool new features to make your customizations even better.

There is a new SelectionTypeId value in Vault 2012.  It's called FileVersion, and if it's in the selection set, it means that a specific version of a file has been selected.  Don't confuse this with SelectionTypeId.File, which means a file is selected, but you don't know the version.

Files in the main grid will have SelectionTypeId.File, whereas selections in the history tab will show up as SelectionTypeId.FileVersion.



The meaning of the ID is different depending on the selection type.  For example, if you want to get the File object from the server, you will call either GetFileById or GetLatestFileByMasterId depending on the selection type.

TypeId Id meaning 
File File.MasterId 
FileVersion File.Id 
Folder Folder.Id 
Item Item.Id 
Bom Item.Id 
Change Order ChangeOrder.Id 
Other "-1" 
Whatever is selected is not supported. 
None Not used 

In practice, you usually want to handle both types when dealing with files.  If you have a file command, you set the type as both File and FileVersion.  When you read in a selection set, you check for both File and FileVersion entries.
 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Links

If you have a link to an entity, it shows up in the selection set as the entity itself.  In other words, your code has no idea it's a link.  A link to a file shows up as a file in the selection set.  Also, you can add links to folders, items and change orders.  So for a given folder, it's possible to have links to many different types of objects.  You can no longer assume that it will always be files like in Vault 2011. 

It's possible for a single selection set to contain a mix files, folders, items and change orders.  So you always want to check the type on the ISelection object before you do anything with the Id value.

 
In the above example, the selection set will contain 4 items, one of each entity type that can be a link target.  The rows that indicate the entity type do not show up in the selection set.

Knowledge Base > Finding by Search Conditions 
Glossary Item Box
by Doug Redmond, It's All Just Ones and Zeros
09/14/2012

 

This article explains how to use the Find X By Search Conditions functions.  These Find functions are the API equivalent of the Advanced Find command in the UI.  Hopefully you are familiar with the following dialog.



The basic idea is that you construct your search criteria by chaining together a bunch of search conditions.  The result set consists of all the entities that match the search conditions.

The results are returned in pages for performance reasons.  By default, 100 is the page size, but that value can be changed in ADMS Console.  You can also define sort criteria, so that the results come back in a specific order.  That way you can hopefully get what you want on the first page.

Each major entity type has it’s own set of Find by Search Conditions functions, but they all work basically the same.  I will be focusing mainly on FindFilesBySearchConditions for this article.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample code
I’ll start by showing the code, then explaining what is going on.


// C#

PropDef [] filePropDefs = m_svcMgr.PropertyService.GetPropertyDefinitionsByEntityClassId("FILE");

PropDef checkedOutPropDef = filePropDefs.Single(n => n.SysName == "CheckoutUserName");

PropDef projectPropDef = filePropDefs.Single(n => n.SysName == "Project");

 

SrchCond isCheckedOut = new SrchCond()

{

    PropDefId = checkedOutPropDef.Id,

    PropTyp = PropertySearchType.SingleProperty,

    SrchOper = 5, // is not empty

    SrchRule = SearchRuleType.Must,

};

 

SrchCond padlockProject = new SrchCond()

{

    PropDefId = projectPropDef.Id,

    PropTyp = PropertySearchType.SingleProperty,

    SrchOper = 3, // is equal

    SrchRule = SearchRuleType.Must,

    SrchTxt = "Padlock"

};

 

string bookmark = string.Empty;

SrchStatus status = null;

List<File> totalResults = new List<File>();

while (status == null || totalResults.Count < status.TotalHits)

{

    File [] results = m_svcMgr.DocumentService.FindFilesBySearchConditions(

        new SrchCond[] { isCheckedOut, padlockProject },

        null, null, false, true, ref bookmark, out status);

 

    if (results != null)

        totalResults.AddRange(results);

    else

        break;

}

// total results now has the results
 
' VB.NET

Dim filePropDefs As PropDef() = _

    m_svcMgr.PropertyService.GetPropertyDefinitionsByEntityClassId("FILE")

Dim checkedOutPropDef As PropDef = _

    filePropDefs.[Single](Function(n) n.SysName = "CheckoutUserName")

Dim projectPropDef As PropDef = _

    filePropDefs.[Single](Function(n) n.SysName = "Project")

 

' SrchOper 5 => is not empty

Dim isCheckedOut As New SrchCond() With { _

       .PropDefId = checkedOutPropDef.Id, _

       .PropTyp = PropertySearchType.SingleProperty, _

       .SrchOper = 5, _ 

       .SrchRule = SearchRuleType.Must _

}

 

' SrchOper 3 => equals

Dim padlockProject As New SrchCond() With { _

       .PropDefId = projectPropDef.Id, _

       .PropTyp = PropertySearchType.SingleProperty, _

       .SrchOper = 3, _

       .SrchRule = SearchRuleType.Must, _

       .SrchTxt = "Padlock" _

}

 

Dim bookmark As String = String.Empty

Dim status As SrchStatus = Nothing

Dim totalResults As New List(Of File)()

While status Is Nothing OrElse totalResults.Count < status.TotalHits

       Dim results As File() = _

          m_svcMgr.DocumentService.FindFilesBySearchConditions( _

           New SrchCond() {isCheckedOut, padlockProject}, _

           Nothing, Nothing, False, True, bookmark, _

              status)

 

       If results IsNot Nothing Then

              totalResults.AddRange(results)

       Else

              Exit While

       End If

End While

' total results now has the results
 


The code is running the same search from the screenshot at the top of the article.  In this case, I want to gather all results, even if it’s bigger than the page size.  I put the Find call in a while loop so that I can keep going, page by page, until I get all the results.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Search Conditions 
The SrchCond objects are the main building blocks of your search.  Each object defines a single condition in the search.  A condition consists of a property, a condition and a value.  For example, “Author is Doug” or “CreateDate is less than 6/31/2011”.  Value may not be used in some cases depending on the condition.  For example, “Checked Out By is not empty”. 

The PropTyp property basically determines if this is an advanced search or a basic search.  “SingleProperty” means advanced search because the value only relates to a single property.  “AllProperties” and “AllPropertiesAndContent” both refer to the basic search feature where a single value is compared against all properties.

SrchOper defines the comparison operator, such as “equals” or “less than”.  It’s a number, and the SDK documentation has a table of all the legal values.

Search Rule is something I covered in another article, so I won’t go over it here.  The advanced find command in the Vault client always uses Must, which means there is an AND relationship between the conditions.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FindFilesBySearchConditions
Here is the function itself.  I won’t be going over every parameter, but I will make sure to cover the tricky ones.

File[] FindFilesBySearchConditions(
   SrchCond[] conditions,
   SrchSort[] sortConditions,
   long[] folderIds,
   bool recurseFolders,
   bool latestOnly,
   ref System.string bookmark,
   out SrchStatus searchstatus
)

The first parameter is the array of search conditions.  You can pass in an empty array, which results in all Files being returned.  It’s actually the most efficient way to scan through all the files in the Vault.

Next is the array of sort objects.  You can pass in null if you don’t care about the order.  If you do want a sort, the SrchSort class is pretty straightforward.  It’s a Vault property you want to sort on, and you can have it be ascending or descending.  The input is an array so that you can sort across multiple properties.  The first object in the array is a primary sort, the second object is the secondary sort, and so on.

FolderIds is for cases where you want to search in a specific set of folders.  If you want to search the whole Vault, pass in null.  Passing in the root folder may slow performance.

Bookmark is for when you need multiple pages returned.  The first time you call Find, you pass in an empty string for the bookmark.  If you don’t get all the results in the first call, bookmark will get updated.  You can then use the bookmark for the next call and it will continue the search from where the last search left off.

Search Status lets you know how many total results there are.  It also lets you know if a re-index is going on.  In the event of a re-index, your results may not be 100% accurate.  There is not much you can do in this case aside from warning the user.

If you are new to Vault programming or want to customize a new area in Vault, then this is the section for you.  On this page, you will find tutorials and basic concepts to get you started.


Vault Architecture
An overview of Vault an all it's pieces.  Special emphasis is placed on the pieces that can be customized and where to go for more information.

How Do I Communicate with the Vault Server?
Just about all the Vault data is stored on the server.  If you want to get, set, update, add or delete any of that data you need to communicate with Vault's web services.

How Do I Customize the Vault Explorer Client?
You can add your own commands and tab views to Vault Explorer.  You can also get events when any other Vault Explorer command is executed.

How Do I Create My Own Jobs?
The jobserver feature allows you to create your own job types.  Learn how to create your own jobs and add them to the queue.  Also learn how to write your own job handler and how to plug it into the Job Processor.

How Do I Respond to Events?
If you want to add your own logic to events, such as when a file is checked in, this section will tell you how.

How Do I Customize the Vault Database?
You don't.  The database and filestore are off limits to development.  If you want to interact with the server data, use the web services framework.

Getting Started > How to Create Custom Jobs 
Glossary Item Box
Jobserver is a nice feature that lets you distribute work across the network.  Instead of performing a task directly, a job can be queued up so that the work can be done elsewhere.  Vault comes with a few built-in job types, but the real power comes in creating your own.


Availability
This feature is not available in base Vault.  Vault Workgroup, Vault Collaboration or Vault Professional is required.


Creating Your Custom Job Type
This part is just about deciding how you want things to work.  Once you have decided what you want your job to do, you can work out some of the specifics.
What you need...

A name for the job type.  This just has to be a string.  We recommend starting with your company name to prevent any possible collisions. 
Example name: Autodesk.TestJob 
The parameters for the job.  This is just a collection of key-value strings.  What goes into this depends on what you want to do.  You might not need any parameters at all. 
Now you are ready to code.


Queuing Your Job
There are two ways to get your Job on the queue.  You can add it yourself using AddJob or you can use the Lifecycle Event Editor utility to have your jobs fire automatically when things change lifecycle state.

If you are adding the job yourself you will need to create the application or plug-in that connects to the Vault Server and calls AddJob.  See the AddJob documentation for more information.

If you are adding the job through lifecycle state changes, then you don't get to decide the parameters.  See the Lifecycle Event Editor documentation for more information.


Handling Your Job
Now that you have code to get the job on the queue, you need to write the code to execute the job when it goes off the queue.  The best thing to do is write a Job Processor extension.  JobProcessor.exe will handle things like managing the queue and logging errors.  All you need to worry about is the actual Job itself. 

The first thing is to set up your project in Visual Studio or other IDE.  You want to create a library project (DLL) and it has to use the .NET framework. 

The next step is to create a public class which implements the IJobHandler interface.  This step requires you to fill in the logic for a bunch of functions.  See the IJobHandler documentation for more details on the functions you need to implement.

There are  5 assembly attributes you need to have in your code:

AssemblyCompany - The name of your company.  
AssemblyProduct - The name of the product.  
AssemblyDescription - A description of your product. 
ExtensionId - A unique GUID for your product.  Visual Studio has a tool that can generate one for you.  Do not copy a GUID from another extension. 
ApiVersion - A string indicating which API schema your product works with.  Enter in "19.0" to work with Vault 2026.

Items 1-3 are provided by Visual Studio in the AssemblyInfo file.  You just need to check that they have accurate data.  Items 4 and 5 need to be created by you.

Once you have everything coded and built, it's time to deploy it.  To deploy you create a folder for your extension under %ProgramData%/Autodesk/Vault 2026/Extensions/.  You can name your folder whatever you want, but it's probably best to name it the same as your product name.  For example, if you DLL is called JobProcessorApiSamples, you would deploy to a folder called "%ProgramData%/Autodesk/Vault 2026/Extensions/JobProcessorApiSamples/".
You need to deploy your DLL, any referenced DLLs and any other files you may need to live alongside the DLL.  You also need a .vcet.config file to go in your folder (see below).

NOTE: The %programData% variable may not be set for all operating systems.  In Windows XP and 2003, this is usually "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data".  In Vista and above, this is usually "C:\ProgramData".

NOTE:  You should not deploy Autodesk.Connectivity.JobProcessor.Extensibility.dll, Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll or Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.dll since they are already part of the Job Processor runtime.

Once everything is deployed, you can start (or restart) JobProcessor to see your handler in action.


The .vcet.config File
This files tells the Vault extensions framework how to load your extension.  It's an XML file with a specific syntax.  Here is what the file should look like for a Job Handler extenstion.
<configuration>
  <connectivity.ExtensionSettings3>
     <extension
      interface="Autodesk.Connectivity.JobProcessor.Extensibility.IJobHandler, Autodesk.Connectivity.JobProcessor.Extensibility, Version=31.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=215b0879a7566597"
      type="MyNamespace.MyClassName, MyAssemblyName">
      <setting key="JobType1" value="MyJobType"/>
    </extension>
  </connectivity.ExtensionSettings3>
</configuration> 
You should replace "MyNamespace.MyClassName" with the full class name if the IJobHandler implementation class.  And you should replace "MyAssemblyName" with the assembly name of your DLL.  Replace "MyJobType" with the job type that your extension implements.  If you support multiple job types, add additional <setting> elements with keys that follow the pattern "JobType2", "JobType3" and so on.

Sample Application
See the JobProcessorApiSamples sample in the SDK for a simple example of how to customize Job Processor.

How to customize Vault Explorer  
Send Feedback  
Getting Started > How to customize Vault Explorer 
Glossary Item Box
There are various ways to customize Vault Explorer through the API.  You can...

Add custom commands. 
Add custom tabs. 
Hide existing commands. 
Subscribe to pre and post events when any Vault Explorer commands are executed. 

Availability
This feature is not available in base Vault.  Vault Workgroup, Vault Collaboration or Vault Professional is required.


Getting Started
The first thing is to set up your project in Visual Studio or other IDE.  You want to create a library project (DLL) and it has to use the .NET framework. 

The next step is to create a public class which implements the IExplorerExtension interface.  This step requires you to fill in the logic for a bunch of functions.  Depending on what you want to do you may be able to leave some of the functions empty or just return null.  See the IExplorerExtention documentation for more details on the functions you need to implement.

There are  5 assembly attributes you need to have in your code:

AssemblyCompany - The name of your company.  
AssemblyProduct - The name of the product.  
AssemblyDescription - A description of your product. 
ExtensionId - A unique GUID for your product.  Visual Studio has a tool that can generate one for you.  Do not copy a GUID from another extension. 
ApiVersion - A string indicating which API schema your product works with.  Enter in "19.0" to work with Vault 2026.

Items 1-3 are provided by Visual Studio in the AssemblyInfo file.  You just need to check that they have accurate data.  Items 4 and 5 need to be created by you.

Once you have everything coded and built, it's time to deploy it.  To deploy you create a folder for your extension under %ProgramData%/Autodesk/Vault 2026/Extensions/.  You can name your folder whatever you want, but it's probably best to name it the same as your product name.  For example, if you DLL is called HelloWorld, you would deploy to a folder called "%ProgramData%/Autodesk/Vault 2026/Extensions/HelloWorld/".
You need to deploy your DLL, any referenced DLLs and any other files you may need to live alongside the DLL.  You also need a .vcet.config file to go in your folder (see below).

NOTE: The %programData% variable may not be set for all operating systems.  In Windows XP and 2003, this is usually "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data".  In Vista and above, this is usually "C:\ProgramData".

NOTE:  You should not deploy Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.dll, Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll or Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.dll since they are already part of the Vault Explorer runtime.

Once everything is deployed, you can start (or restart) Vault Explorer to see your customization in action.

This files tells the Vault extensions framework how to load your extension.  It's an XML file with a specific syntax.  Here is what the file should look like for a Vault Explorer extenstion.
<configuration>
  <connectivity.ExtensionSettings3>
    <extension

      type="MyNamespace.MyClassName, MyAssemblyName">
    </extension>
  </connectivity.ExtensionSettings3>
</configuration>
 

You should replace "MyNamespace.MyClassName" with the full class name if the IExplorerExtension implementation class.  And you should replace "MyAssemblyName" with the assembly name of your DLL.

How to handle events  
Send Feedback  
Getting Started > How to handle events 
Glossary Item Box
If you want to customize the business logic, you can write event handlers.  These handlers will receive notification whenever a Vault client on that machine does an action that you subscribed to.  For example if a program tries to check in a file, your code can get notified of that action.  Then you can proceed to block the operation or perform additional tasks.


Availability
This feature is not available in base Vault.  Vault Workgroup, Vault Collaboration or Vault Professional is required.


Getting Started
The first thing is to set up your project in Visual Studio or other IDE.  You want to create a library project (DLL) and it has to use the .NET framework. 

The next step is to create a public class which implements the IWebServiceExtension interface.  This interface has only 1 method to implement, OnLoad.  In that function you hook to all the events you want to get notification on.  After that you need to provide logic for each event you want to handle.

There are  5 assembly attributes you need to have in your code:

AssemblyCompany - The name of your company.  
AssemblyProduct - The name of the product.  
AssemblyDescription - A description of your product. 
ExtensionId - A unique GUID for your product.  Visual Studio has a tool that can generate one for you.  Do not copy a GUID from another extension. 
ApiVersion - A string indicating which API schema your product works with.  Enter in "19.0" to work with Vault 2026.

You can name your folder whatever you want, but it's probably best to name it the same as your product name.  For example, if you DLL is called RestrictOperations, you would deploy to a folder called "%ProgramData%/Autodesk/Vault 2026/Extensions/RestrictOptions/".
You need to deploy your DLL, any referenced DLLs and any other files you may need to live alongside the DLL.  You also need a .vcet.config file to go in your folder (see below).

NOTE: The %programData% variable may not be set for all operating systems.  In Windows XP and 2003, this is usually "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data".  In Vista and above, this is usually "C:\ProgramData".

NOTE:  You should not deploy Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll or Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.dll since they are already part of the hosting application's runtime.

Once everything is deployed, you can start (or restart) the vault client application to see your event handlers in action.


The .vcet.config File
This files tells the Vault extensions framework how to load your extension.  It's an XML file with a simple syntax.  Here is what the file should look like for a Vault Explorer extension.

      type="MyNamespace.MyClassName, MyAssemblyName">
    </extension>
  </connectivity.ExtensionSettings3>
</configuration> 
You should replace "MyNamespace.MyClassName" with the full class name if the IWebServiceExtension implementation class.  And you should replace "MyAssemblyName" with the assembly name of your DLL.

Glossary Item Box
by Doug Redmond, It's All Just Ones and Zeros
06/01/2010



At a High Level:
Properties are a type of Behavior, which basically means it's a feature that works on Entities instead of specific object types.  There are 2 things we do with this concept:  1) we consolidate the feature and 2) we allow data to be shared across entity types.

These concepts can be seen on the Properties dialog (Tools menu->Administration->Vault Settings->Behaviors tab->Properties button).  Everything is in one dialog instead of being separated by File, Item and Change Order.



This dialog gives you a nice list of Property Definitions.  Notice how each definition is associated with 1 or more entity classes.  This is nice because you can define a property definition once and use it multiple places.  A property definition can only work with entity classes that it is associated with.

You can also associate property definitions with categories.  This allows you to change the behavior of the property depending on the category that the entity is.  This feature allows for more specialization while still promoting reuse.

System Properties and UDPs:
Properties maintained by Vault are either System properties or User Defined Properties (UDPs).  The main difference is that UDPs values can be edited directly, and system property values are set by the system.  At the property definition level, system properties have only a few edit options.  Likewise, system properties cannot be added or deleted. 

Content Source Properties:
Vault Properties do many things.  They fill in the data grids, they allow searching, they allow lifecycle state restrictions, etc.  All this is possible because Vault "owns" this data.  Vault keeps the data in its tables and indexes, and everything is organized to support the Vault features. 

But what about properties not owned by Vault?  Those properties aren't organized by Vault and aren't in a format that Vault recognizes.  We refer to these as Content Source Properties because they are content form a source other than Vault.  So how can Vault work with this data?

The solution is to map the content source property to a UDP.  That way Vault can do all it's operations on the UDP without having to know or care about the mechanics of the content source property.

The glue between the content source property and the UDP is a module called a Content Source Provider.  It contains the logic to read and/or write content source properties and interact with the Vault framework.  These providers are broken up by file type.  So there is one for AutoCAD and one for Inventor and so on.  There is also an "All Files" provider to handle all files not claimed by another provider.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



File Properties
In the last section, I mentioned how the properties concept spans multiple entity classes.  However there are still implementation details that are unique to each class.  In this section, I will focus specifically on file properties.

Content Source Properties
In the context of Files, a content source property represents a property within the file.  This might be a title block attribute from an AutoCAD file, or an iProperty from an Inventor file, or a structured storage property from a Microsoft Office file.  A property may even be something more abstract, such as the number of colors in a JPG file.  The point is that the property lives inside the file, and Vault needs a way to read and write this information. 

As I mentioned in the last section, the content source provider is the glue that reads and writes content source properties from a file and maps them to Vault UDPs.  Because each file type is different, there are multiple providers, broken up by file type.

The "All Files" provider is a special case.  It's the one that gets used when no other provider is available.  This provider works by using the Windows iFilter mechanism to read the content source properties.  If no suitable iFilter is found, then content source properties cannot be read for that file type.  The "All Files" provider cannot be used to write content source properties.

Mappings
Content Source Properties are useless to Vault unless they are mapped to a UDP.  If you've seen the Properties dialog, you have probably noticed a bunch of complex options. 



Mappings between content source properties and UDPs have a direction component.  You can have mappings from content to UDP, or from UDP to content, or bi-directional mappings.  Not all properties support all 3 mapping types.  The provider decides which mappings are supported.  When writing to content, there is a "create" option which means the provider can create the property in the file if the property does not already exist.  If the value is NO, the provider will only update an existing property. 

Mapping Type What it means for files 
Content -> UDP When a file is versioned, the file property value is copied to the UDP value. 
UDP -> Content When a "writeback" operation occurs in Vault, the UDP value is written to the file.  This process creates a new file version. 
Bi-directional UDP is updated with a new file version and the content property is updated on writeback. 

Setting up a mapping
In order to set up the mapping, you must have a file that contains the content source property you want to map.  In Vault Explorer, you select the file, which can either be in Vault already or on your local disk.  Next, you are presented with the possible properties that you can map to.  Once you select the file property, you can choose the direction of the mapping.

When you click OK, Vault updates the UDP with information about the mapped content source property.



You should also notice that A) you can have several providers mapped to the same UDP and B) each mapping is independent of the other mappings.  A given file will map to 1 and only 1 provider, so there is no danger of conflict. 

Monikers
This is a good time to talk about monikers.  A moniker is a string that the provider uses to locate the property.  Outside the provider, the moniker is just opaque metadata.  For example, "15!{D5CDD502-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}!nvarchar" is the moniker that the Inventor provider uses to locate the Company iProperty.  That string is meaningless to you and me, it is meaningless to Vault and it is meaningless to the other providers.   

The only thing that Vault does with the moniker string is to store it with the mapped UDP.  Whenever Vault needs to read or write a content source property, it passes the moniker in to the provider so that it can locate the correct property.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



This section will focus on Item properties, so feel free to skip this one if you are not using Vault Professional or do not use Items. 


Item Properties
Items is one of those features where the UI makes it look like things work one way, but at the API level, things are completely different.  Unmapped Item UDPs are pretty straightforward.  It's when you get into mapped properties that things get confusing.

For example, take the following workflow:

Create a new Property 
Associate it to File and Item 
Set up the File mappings 
Save the Property 
Upload a file with the property in it.  The UDP contains the expected value. 
Assign the file to an item.  
The item does not contain the UDP value like you might expect.  The reason is that you still need to set up the Item mapping.  The file value doesn't automatically copy over to the item just because the Item box is checked on the property. 
Mappings
Items also support mapping between UDP and a Content Source Property.  But the meaning is different for Items.  Item properties do not map to data within the file. 

You know that 'bom' parameter on the add and checkin functions?  That's what Item properties map to.  The BOM contains bill of materials data for the file.  The central objects in the BOM are the BOMComp objects.  BOMComp objects can map to Item objects.  Therefore BOMProp objects are what the Item UDPs map to.

Content Source Providers
So Item properties still have the concept of a content source property.  But the file's BOM is the content source in this case, not the file itself.  Again, the content source provider is the glue that hooks the content source property to the UDP.  So depending on the file type, the Item mapping behavior may be different.

Reference Designators
This is the only other entity class that supports property mappings.  Just like with Items, a Reference Designator property maps to data in the BOM.  The only difference is that the mapping is to BOMProp data on a BOMRefDesig object.

AutoCAD Electrical is the only application that sets reference designator BOM data.  So mappings are only possible with the content source provider that handles .dwg files.

How to get the list of legal values for a property definition
If you have a property definition that contains a list of legal values, you need to get the PropDefInfo object to read that list of values.  GetPropertyDefinitionInfosByEntityClassId is the only way to get this object, but it seems that you need to be an administrator to call this function.  There is an undocumented trick to get this information with normal permissions.  Pass in null to the 'propertyDefIds' parameter.  It will return all PropDefInfo objects and it will remove the admin requirement.

C Sharp
 Copy Code 
// Get all file PropDefInfo objects

PropDefInfo[] propDefInfos = webServiceManager.PropertyService.GetPropertyDefinitionInfosByEntityClassId("FILE", null);
 

VB.NET Copy Code 
' Get all file PropDefInfo objects

Dim propDefInfos As PropDefInfo() = webServiceManager.PropertyService.GetPropertyDefinitionInfosByEntityClassId("FILE", Nothing)
 

How to look up a system property
For system properties it's OK to hardcode the system name since the name will be the same in all vaults and languages.  FindPropertyDefinitionsBySystemNames is the API function to use and it's pretty straightforward in how it works.  The trick is finding the system name.  In the properties dialog, you can customize the columns to show the system name of each property definition.



Note that the systems names are nice and simple.  However any UDPs that you create will have a randomly generated GUID attached to them.  So the system name is not a good way to look up UDPs.

How to look up a mapped property
Sometimes all you care about is the file property and you want to see the vault PropDef that has a read mapping to that file property.  Hardcoding the system name isn't helpful since UDP names and property mappings may change from vault to vault.

What you need is to find the moniker for the file property and use that file to find the vault PropDef.  Note: there may be no mappings or multiple mappings to the file property.

C Sharp Copy Code 
// the moniker for the "Company" property in an Inventor file.

string moniker = "15!{D5CDD502-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}!nvarchar";

List<PropDefInfo> mappedToContent = new List<PropDefInfo>();

foreach (PropDefInfo propDefInfo in propDefInfos)

{

    bool matchFound = false;

    if (propDefInfo.EntClassCtntSrcPropCfgArray == null)

        continue;

    foreach (EntClassCtntSrcPropCfg contentSource in propDefInfo.EntClassCtntSrcPropCfgArray)

    {

        if (contentSource.EntClassId != "FILE" || contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray == null)

            continue;

        for (int i = 0; i < contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray.Length; i++)

        {

            if (contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray[i].Moniker == moniker &&

                contentSource.MapDirectionArray[i] == MappingDirection.Read)

            {

                mappedToContent.Add(propDefInfo);

                matchFound = true;

                break;

            }

        }

        if (matchFound)

            break;

    }

}

            Exit For

How to find the moniker
This is a bit tricky.  I don't recommend trying to figure out the syntax we use.  Instead I recommend the following:

Create a new UDP and map it to the property within the file. 
Write a code snippet that gets the PropDefInfo object for your UDP. 
In the debugger expand out the EntClassCtntSrcPropCfgArray of the PropDefInfo object. 
You should be able to find the mapping along with the moniker value. 
Copy the moniker value into your code. 


How to find the CtntSrc object for a file
CtntSrc is the object representing a content source provider.  Each file will have 1 and only 1 provider.  You can locate the correct object using the Provider system property on a file.

C Sharp Copy Code 
IEnumerable<PropDefInfo> results = propDefInfos.Where(prop => prop.PropDef.SysName == "Provider");

PropDefInfo providerProp = results.First();

PropInst[] values = webServiceManager.PropertyService.GetProperties("FILE", new long[] { file.Id }, new long[] { providerProp.PropDef.Id });

string providerName = (string)values[0].Val;

ServerCfg config = webServiceManager.AdminService.GetServerConfiguration();

IEnumerable<CtntSrc> providers = config.CtntSrcArray.Where(source => source.DispName == providerName);

if (providers.Count() == 0)

    providers = config.CtntSrcArray.Where(source => source.SysName == "IFilter");

CtntSrc provider = providers.First();
 

VB.NET Copy Code 
Dim results As IEnumerable(Of PropDefInfo) = From propDefInfo In propDefInfos _

    Where propDefInfo.PropDef.SysName = "Provider" _

    Select propDefInfo

Dim providerProp As PropDefInfo = results.First()

Dim values As PropInst() = webServiceManager.PropertyService.GetProperties("FILE", New Long() {file.Id}, New Long() {providerProp.PropDef.Id})

Dim providerName As String = DirectCast(values(0).Val, String)

Dim config As ServerCfg = webServiceManager.AdminService.GetServerConfiguration()

Dim providers As IEnumerable(Of CtntSrc) = From source In config.CtntSrcArray _

    Where source.DispName = providerName _

    Select source

If providers.Count() = 0 Then

    providers = config.CtntSrcArray.Where(Function(source) source.SysName = "IFilter")

Note:  "IFilter" is the system name to the "All Files" provider.  This should be used if the provider value is blank or there is no match to any other provider.

How to update a UDP value on a file
There are two ways of doing this.  The correct way depends on if the UDP is mapped or not.

The unmapped UDP is the simple case, you just call UpdateFileProperties.  If the UDP has a read mapping, UpdateFileProperties will not help you.  The reason is because when the file is checked in, the file's internal value will overwrite the UDP value you just set.  The correct thing to do is to update the property inside the local file before checking it back in to Vault.  This means that you need to use the appropriate CAD API to set the file data.  Once the file is checked in, the Vault server will update the mapped UDP value

C Sharp Copy Code 
// TO DO: checkout file 


if (isMapped)
{
    // TO DO: update local file with CAD API
}
else
{
    // TO DO: call UpdateFileProperties
} 


// TO DO: checkin file
 

How to tell if a UDP is mapped

Here is code to determine if a property has a read mapping or not.  Since each provider sets its own mappings, you need the CtntSrc object from the earlier section.

C Sharp Copy Code 
IEnumerable<PropDefInfo> results = propDefInfos.Where(prop => prop.PropDef.Id == propDefId);

PropDefInfo theProperty = results.First();

bool isMapped = false;

if (theProperty.EntClassCtntSrcPropCfgArray != null)

{

    foreach (EntClassCtntSrcPropCfg contentSource in theProperty.EntClassCtntSrcPropCfgArray)

    {

        if (contentSource.EntClassId != "FILE" || contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray == null)

            continue;

        for (int i = 0; i < contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray.Length; i++)

        {

            if (contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray[i].CtntSrcId == provider.Id &&

                contentSource.MapDirectionArray[i] == MappingDirection.Read)

            {

                 isMapped = true;

            }

        }

    }

}
 

VB.NET Copy Code 
Dim results As IEnumerable(Of PropDefInfo) = From prop In propDefInfos _

    Where prop.PropDef.Id = propDefId _

    Select prop

Dim theProperty As PropDefInfo = results.First()

Dim isMapped As Boolean = False

If theProperty.EntClassCtntSrcPropCfgArray IsNot Nothing Then

    For Each contentSource As EntClassCtntSrcPropCfg In theProperty.EntClassCtntSrcPropCfgArray

        If contentSource.EntClassId <> "FILE" OrElse contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray Is Nothing Then

            Continue For

        End If

        For i As Integer = 0 To contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray.Length - 1

            If contentSource.CtntSrcPropDefArray(i).CtntSrcId = provider.Id AndAlso contentSource.MapDirectionArray(i) = MappingDirection.Read Then

                isMapped = True

            End If

        Next

    Next

End If

Glossary Item Box
Restrictions are types of exceptions with extra data documenting why an operation failed.  If the error code is 1092, 1387, or 1633, then there is restriction information, otherwise there is no restriction information.  An exception can have multiple restriction.  Each restriction has its own error code and an ordered list of parameters providing information specific to the error.

Below is an example of the XML of an exception with restriction data:

<sl:sldetail xmlns:sl=\"http://streamline.autodesk.com/faultschema\">  <sl:errorcode>1387</sl:errorcode>  <sl:mesg-id>632521940579843750</sl:mesg-id><sl:stack>\nServer stack trace:  at Connectivity.Product.Services.ItemService.CheckRestrictionsByItemIterationIds(ProductRestrictionCodes[] restrictionCodes, Int64[] itemIterationIds) in H:\\Server\\Product\\Services\\ItemService.cs:line 114 at Connectivity.Product.Services.ItemService.CheckRestrictionsByItemRevisionIds(ProductRestrictionCodes[] restrictionCodes, Int64[] itemRevisionIds) in H:\\Server\\Product\\Services\\ItemService.cs:line 97 at Connectivity.Product.Services.ItemService.EditItemRevisionInternal(Int64 itemRevId, Boolean bypassWIPRestriction) in H:\\Server\\Product\\Services\\ItemService.cs:line 1149 at Connectivity.Product.Services.ItemService.EditItemRevisionInternal(Int64 itemRevId) in H:\\Server\\Product\\Services\\ItemService.cs:line 1128 at Connectivity.Product.Services.ItemService.EditItemRevision(Int64 itemRevId) in H:\\Server\\Product\\Services\\ItemService.cs:line 1124 at System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.Message.Dispatch(Object target, Boolean fExecuteInContext) at System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.StackBuilderSink.SyncProcessMessage(IMessage msg, Int32 methodPtr, Boolean fExecuteInContext)Exception rethrown at [0]:  at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.HandleReturnMessage(IMessage reqMsg, IMessage retMsg) at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.PrivateInvoke(MessageData&amp; msgData, Int32 type) at Connectivity.Product.Services.ItemService.EditItemRevision(Int64 itemRevId) in H:\\Server\\Product\\Services\\ItemService.cs:line 1124 at Connectivity.Web.Services.ItemService.EditItemRevision(Int64 itemRevisionId) in H:\\Server\\Web\\Services\\ItemService.asmx.cs:line 780</sl:stack><sl:restrictions>  <sl:restriction sl:code=\"2001\">    <sl:param sl:index=\"0\">000001</sl:param>    <sl:param sl:index=\"1\">Test Item</sl:param>    <sl:param sl:index=\"2\">2</sl:param>    <sl:param sl:index=\"3\">Released</sl:param>  </sl:restriction></sl:restrictions></sl:sldetail>

 

The <sl:restrictions> tag holds the list of restrictions.
The <sl:restriction> tag holds a single restriction.  The sl:code attribute contains the restriction code.
The <sl:param> tag holds a piece of information specific to the error.  The sl:index attribute contains the order that the param is in.  0 is the first param, 1 is the second param, etc.

See the Error Codes page for an explanation of the other XML components.

Server Error Codes

Glossary Item Box
If a web service method is called and an error occurs, a SoapException (in System.Web.Services.Protocols) will be raised. This exception contains XML data in a property called "Details". If you were to print out this XML, it would look something like this:

<sl:sldetail xmlns:sl=\"http://streamline.autodesk.com/faultschema\">          <sl:errorcode>102</sl:errorcode>          <sl:mesg-id>632374075548091123</sl:mesg-id>          <sl:param sl:pid=\"1\">Vault</sl:param>          <sl:stack>\nServer stack trace:    at Connectivity.Core.Services.KnowledgeVaultService.AddKnowledgeVault(String vaultName, String filestore, Category categoryId)   at System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.Message.Dispatch(Object target, Boolean fExecuteInContext)   at System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.StackBuilderSink.SyncProcessMessage(IMessage msg, Int32 methodPtr, Boolean fExecuteInContext)Exception rethrown at [0]:    at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.HandleReturnMessage(IMessage reqMsg, IMessage retMsg)   at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.PrivateInvoke(MessageData& msgData, Int32 type)   at Connectivity.Core.Services.KnowledgeVaultService.AddKnowledgeVault(String vaultName, String filestore, Category categoryId)   at Connectivity.Web.Services.KnowledgeVaultService.AddKnowledgeVault(String vaultName, Category category)</sl:stack>        </sl:sldetail>

 

The Vault error code can be found between the <sl:errorcode> tags. Also, some errors will be accompanied by extra information in the form of a string array, found between the <sl:param> tags. Each parameter will have its own tag and "pid", which is an index value starting at 1. Most errors will not have extra parameters.

The Message property on the exception will usually contain the error code and the name of the error (for example, "102 --> KnowledgeVaultExists"). However, parsing the XML returned by the exception is the recommended and safest technique to obtain the error code and its meaning.

Below is a table listing possible error codes, their description and meaning, and how the error would appear to the user.

Introduction
All client/server communication, including file transfers, is done through HTTP.  The web service specification does not include transfer of binary data, so Web Service Extensions 3.0 (WSE) is used to upload and download files.   

AcquireFiles is the recommended function for downloading and checking out files.  AddFile and CheckinFile are the recommended functions for uploading files.  These functions also provide extra functionality automatically, including batch downloading, large file transfer, compression and file reference fixing.

Configuring Client Applications
4 MB is the default HTTP transfer limit allowed by WSE.  Increasing this value requires editing the client's config file.  Config files have special meaning to .NET applications.  This page just covers how to modify these files to adjust the transfer limit.  More detailed information on config files can be found in the Microsoft documentation.

The below settings need to be present in the .config file to allow a 50 MB limit.

<configuration>      <configSections>              <section name="microsoft.web.services3"          type="Microsoft.Web.Services3.Configuration.WebServicesConfiguration, Microsoft.Web.Services3, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" />     </configSections>     <microsoft.web.services3>             <messaging>                   <maxRequestLength value="51200" />            </messaging>          <mtom clientMode="On" />      </microsoft.web.services3> </configuration>

 

MTOM - WSE 3.0 uses MTOM to transfer binary data.  If MTOM is not enabled or WSE 3.0 is not installed, file transfers will still work, but they will be base 64 encoded.  For performance reasons, WSE should always be used and MTOM should always be enabled.  Base 64 encoding hurts performances since it results in more data being transferred. 

To enable MTOM, make sure that the section <mtom clientMode="On" /> is in the <microsoft.web.services3> section of the config file.

Standalone applications - In Visual Studio, create an XML file called app.config if one does not already exist.  Next copy the above XML into app.config.  If the project already has an app.config, then the sections above need to be merged into the existing file. 

When the project gets built, the app.config file gets renamed to [EXE name].config.  For example, if your application is called VaultList.exe, then VaultList.exe.config is the name of the config file.  The config file must always be in the same directory as the EXE.   When distributing the application, the config file must be distributed as well.

Application Libraries / Plug-ins - Config files are associated with EXEs not DLLs.  So if an application is a DLL it will not have a config file of its own.  In this case, a config file is required on the EXE which is running the plug-in.  Even if the EXE is not a .NET application, it can still have a config file.  For example, Inventor.exe.config is used for the Vault plug-in.

If a DLL is to be used by multiple programs, than each one needs its own config file.  If a config file exists, than the needed settings need to be merged in.

Web applications - Web applications also have a config file, which is named web.config.  If web.config does not exist, add it to the project and copy in the XML data above. If one already exists, then the XML data needs to be merged in.

Vault is basically a client/server framework.


Server Components
No parts of the server are customizable, and there are rules for how to get and set server data.

Autodesk Data Management Server (ADMS)
Also known as the Vault Server, this component contains most of the business logic for the Vault system.  It is the middle tier between the storage layer (database and file store) and the clients.
ADMS uses web services to expose an API for communicating with the server.  This is the only mechanism for Vault clients to communicate with the server.  The WebServiceManager or Connection object is the recommended mechanism for making web service calls to ADMS.

File Store
This component is a folder hierarchy that stores all the files uploaded to Vault.  Direct access or manipulation is not allowed.

Database
This component stores all of the non-file data.  Direct access or manipulation is not allowed.


Client Components
A Vault client is basically anything that communicates with ADMS through the web services API.  There are various pieces of client-side business logic that are spread out among the various client applications.

Vault Explorer
This application is the main mechanism for browsing and managing Vault data.  Technically there are 4 types of Vault Explorers, 1 for each product type.  So there is a "Vault Basic", "Vault Workgroup", "Vault Collaboration" and "Vault Professional" versions of Vault Explorer.  However it is usually more convenient to refer to them all as Vault Explorer.
Customization options:  Add commands, add tab views, subscribe to command events.  Click here for more information.

Autoloader
This utility is a bulk loader for CAD data.  Like all other Vault clients, it uses web service calls to send data to the server. 
This application cannot be customized.

CAD Applications
Examples of these applications include AutoCAD, Inventor and Civil 3D.   It's basically the CAD application with a plug-in that interfaces with the Vault Server.  Not only do these plug-ins send the files to the server, they also send the corresponding meta-data for the files. 
Although the CAD applications themselves can usually be customized, the Vault plug-ins are not customizable.

Job Processor
This utility takes Jobs off the queue and executes them.  Although it is technically not a Windows service, it operates like one.  It is designed to always be running with little to no user interaction.
Customization options:  Add plug-ins which contain custom job handlers.  Click here for more information.

Webserver
This component is the thing that generates the web pages for the web feature in Vault.  Although a browser views this as a server, it is viewed as a client by ADMS. 
This component cannot be customized.

Custom Applications
The web service API is publicly available, which means that anyone can write a Vault client.  In theory, a custom application can do anything that a Vault client can do since they both use the same API to communicate to ADMS.  Click here for more information.

Global Customization
It's possible to update the client-side business logic for all clients.  Event handlers can be written for certain operations in the Web Service API.   These events will fire from all clients.  For example, if you write a handler for the File CheckIn event, your handler will get notification whenever AutoCAD checks in a file and whenever Vault Explorer checks in a file.

Vault Explorer Command Events  
Send Feedback  
Knowledge Base > Vault Explorer Command Events 
Glossary Item Box
by Doug Redmond, It's All Just Ones and Zeros
09/21/2011



Vault 2012 was a very eventful release for the API in the sense that 3 event engines were added for you to hook to in your programs.  I've already talked about Web Service Command Events, which is the most complex of the 3.  Now let me switch to the most simple type, Vault Explorer Command Events.

Whenever any UI command is invoked in Vault Explorer, it will fire a pre and a post to anyone that subscribes.  The UI command is basically everything in the main menu, toolbars, and context menus.  In your handler, you get passed in the key string for that command.  And that's it.  You don't get the selection context and you don't get any information about what happened during the command.

It told you it was simple.  But, just because a feature is simple doesn't mean it's useless.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are a couple of uses to get things started...

Use #1:  Cache clearing

Sometimes I find myself building up a cache in my custom command.  For example, I'll need to read all the file Property Definitions.  I don't want to read these objects each time my command is invoked, so I save the data in memory.  But what if I want to keep my cache up-to-date?  I just need to check for the Refresh or Admin Settings command and clear the cache at that point.

Use #2:  Event combo

Web Service Command events are good at knowing what work is being done but only in isolation.  They don't know what overall command is being done.  Vault Explorer Command events are just the opposite.  If you combine the two, you have a fairly complete picture.

Here is the timeline of a Copy Design operation that creates 3 files.  The top blue lines are the Vault Explorer events, the bottom blue lines are the web service events, and the red lines are the web service function calls. 



We can make good use of all these events.  For example, you can send out an email report after a copy design is completed.  Here is how you would do it:

In the Vault Explorer pre event for Copy Design:  Create a new List. 
In the DocumentService AddFile post event:  Add the File to your List. 
In the Vault Explorer post event for Copy Design:  Use the entries in the List to send out the email report explaining which files were added via Copy Design.

A Vault client will work with only one set of web services.  However the Vault server may support multiple web service version side by side.  Here is a chart explaining what versions are supported for a given server release.


Vault 2012 and earlier Support curent web service API only. 
Vault 2013 Support for 2012 and 2013 web services. 
Vault 2014 Support for 2012, 2013 and 2014 web services. 
Vault 2015 Support for 2013*, 2014*, and 2015 web services 


*ItemService and PackageService are disabled for Vault 2015 server compatibility layers

For plug-ins, there is no compatiblity.  For example, a custom command in Vault Explorer 2013 will need to be updated in order to work with Vault Explorer 2014. 

Service Packs and Point Releases
Clients are compatible with different services packs of the ADMS.  For example, a client written against Vault 2011 will work against Vault 2011 SP1.

Point releases do not have compatible APIs.  For example, a client written against ADMS 4.0 will not work against ADMS 4.5.

The Information Service
The Information Service is the one service that will work for all versions of ADMS from R5 and up.  The purpose of the service is to grab information about the ADMS, including the version.  GetSystemProducts allows a client to pre-check the server version first to determine if its compatible.



Updating to a New ADMS Version
Since the API is not backwards compatible, here are the recommended steps for updating a client to a new version of ADMS.

Open your project. 
Update your web references and compile. 
If you get build errors, open the SDK documentation to figure out how to proceed:                                                                       
- If the parameters have changed for a function, look up the help document for that function for an explanation of the new parameters.
- If the function is missing, look in the "Changes" page to see what new function should be used. 
Once everything compiles, run and test.

Web Service Command Event - FAQ  
Send Feedback  
Knowledge Base > Web Service Command Event - FAQ 
Glossary Item Box
by Doug Redmond, It's All Just Ones and Zeros
04/08/2011

 

What is the Event feature in the Vault 2012 API?
For Vault 2012, a feature was added called Web Service Command Events, which allows you to run custom code before and after certain Vault operations are executed.  For example, you can perform custom operations after a file gets checked-in.


What is the scope of my event handlers?
Your handlers will hook to any application on that computer using Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.  Starting in Vault 2012 all Autodesk Vault clients use this DLL for communication with the server.  So you can hook to applications like Vault Explorer, AutoCAD, Inventor, Civil 3D, and so on.

Let me restate, that this feature runs client side.  So if you have 100 Vault users, your event code needs to be deployed to 100 computers in order to grab all events.


What Vault products does this feature work with?
Vault Workgroup, Vault Collaboration and Vault Professional.  It is not available in base Vault.


What operations can I receive events for?
Most events can be displayed in a grid:


  File Folder Item Change Order 
Add Yes Yes Yes Yes 
Delete Yes Yes Yes Yes 
Reserve for editing Yes (checkout) No Yes
(edit) Yes
(edit) 
Commit Changes Yes
(checkin) No Yes
(commit) Yes
(commit) 
Change Lifecycle Yes No Yes Yes 


In addition to the ones listed in the grid, you can receive events for File Download, Item Rollback Lifecycle, and Item Promote.


What are the events I can hook to for a given operation?
Each operation fires 3 events:

GetRestrictions - This part allows event handlers to block the operation. 
Pre - This part allows event handlers to run code before the operation takes place. 
Post - This part allows event handlers to run code after the operation has finished. 

When and where do these events fire?
Here is the basic timeline:


If restrictions are found during the GetRestrictioins phase, the operation is blocked and never continues to the Pre.  If there are no restrictions, things continue to the Pre.  Unless something unexpected occurs, Pre, Web Service call and Post should always execute.

As you can see, the events happen around the web service call.  In other words, at the layer where the client communicates with the server. 

Keep in mind these events may or may not correlate with the UI command that the user invokes. For example, a user performs a Get command on a file in Vault Explorer.  This may trigger multiple download events if an entire assembly needs to be download.  Or it may trigger no events if the file on disk is up-to-date.


What can I do in an event handler?
Inside a GetRestrictions event you can block the operation and provide the reason for the restriction.  Inside a Pre and a Post event you run extra operations, such as sending off an email or queuing up a Job.


What can't I do in an event handler?
You can't change the parameters to or from the operation.  You can see most of the parameters passed in, but you can't change them.  Likewise you see the return result, but you can't alter it.  For example, in the Pre AddFile event you can see that the file name parameter is "Part1.dwg", your code cannot change that name to "ZX-0389.dwg".

You should also avoid UI in an event handler.  You don't know what context your handler is running in.  For example, you could be running in a command line utility or a service.

Bubbling up exceptions is not a good idea.  Again, you don't know the context you are running in, so an exception might end up shutting down the parent application.  The safest thing is to wrap each event handler in a try/catch block.

Lastly, make sure you don't create and infinite recursion of events.  For example, during a Pre AddFile event, your code adds a file, which triggers an AddFile event, which causes your code to add a file, and so on.  Even if your code works fine on its own, remember that there might be other event handlers loaded.  So your handler might run and operation that triggers another handler, which runs an operation that triggers back to your handler, and so on ad infinitum. 


If the Vault server throws an error do I get a Post event?
Yes, and you can see the Exception that is thrown.


Am I guaranteed a Post event?
Not in all cases.  It's technically possible for the operation to complete on the server, but your computer loses power right before the Post event.  However during normal operation, yes, you will always get a Post event.


Is there anyway to enforce that an Event fires?
No.  If the computer doesn't have your handler installed, or your hander fails to load for some reason, the operation will go through without hitting your code.


How do I write an event handler?
A detailed list of steps can be found in the Getting Started section of the API documentation.  The RestrictOperations sample in the SDK has sample code.

Here are the basic steps:

Create your DLL project 
Reference Auotdesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll 
Add a class that implements IWebServiceExtension 
In the OnLoad() implementation, hook to the events that you care about.  The hooks are on the web services objects themselves.  (ex.  DocumentService.AddFileEvents.GetRestrictions ) 
Write the event handler code 
Deploy 

I wrote a Vault client, will event handlers be hooking to my application?
If you use Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll to communicate with the Vault Server, yes.  So your code should handle cases where operations are blocked by other event handlers.  In your app, these restrictions will bubble up as an Exception of type Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.ExtensionException.


Are my handlers specific to a version of Vault?
Yes.  For example, your Vault 2012 extension can handle events from the Vault 2012 version of Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll, but not from any other version of the DLL.


Which Web Service functions fire which events?
You can see the full mapping in the Web Service Command Event Mappings of the Knowledge Base in the Vault SDK documentation.  There are no cases where a web service function fires multiple events.


Are there other event types?
Yes, but I'll cover those in another post.

XML Serialization

Knowledge Base > XML Serialization 
Glossary Item Box

One thing you might not be aware of is that all the API classes are XML Serializable.  This means that it’s very easy to convert on object to XML text and vice versa. 

There many uses for this feature.  For example…

It can you in your debugging.  If you have a large object with lots of data, it’s sometimes helpful to have an XML view of that object.  At the bottom of this page is a XML serilization of a LfCycDef object. 
If you are logging a case with ADN, you can include serialized objects as part of your problem description. 
Store information for later use.  Just keep in mind that the class might change in the next release. 
You can use it as a way to check if things have been changed.  For example, you wrote a program that requires a very specific lifecycle setup.  You want your program to detect if somebody comes along and tampers with the settings. 
Here is some sample code to go along with my last example.

C Sharp Copy Code 
public bool DidItChange(LfCycDef def)

{

    // serialize the object

    StringBuilder currentXML = new StringBuilder();

    XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(LfCycDef));

　

    using (TextWriter writer = new StringWriter(currentXML))

    {

        serializer.Serialize(writer, def);

    }

    // read in the stored XML

    string originalXML = System.IO.File.ReadAllText("correct.xml");

 

    // now all you have to do is compare the two

    return (originalXML != currentXML.ToString());

}
 

VB.NET Copy Code 
Private Function DidItChange(def As LfCycDef) As Boolean

    ' serialize the object

    Dim currentXML As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()

    Dim serializer As XmlSerializer = New XmlSerializer(GetType(LfCycDef))

    Using writer As TextWriter = New System.IO.StringWriter(currentXML)

        serializer.Serialize(writer, def)

    End Using

 

    ' read in the stored XML

    Dim originalXML As String = System.IO.File.ReadAllText("flex.xml")

 

    ' now all you have to do is compare the two

    Return (originalXML <> currentXML.ToString())

End Function
